# ImageRy data description :üõ∞Ô∏è

Data are stored in: https://github.com/ducciorocchini/imageRy/tree/main/inst/images
and can be seen in R by the function im.list() and further imported by im.import(). Here is a description of the set in alphabetical order:

We did our best to reduce the weight of data in order to facilitate RS data analysis.
Hence, most of the data are original sets with coordinate systems recorderded. Other sets are pre-analysed data mainly downloadable from the NASA Earth Observatory () site.
In case of NASA Earth Observatory data we basically maintained the same name of images. In this manner a simple search of the name in any browser will directly lead to the original storybeyond each image.

## Solar_Orbiter_s_first_views_of_the_Sun_pillars.jpg
ESA's Solar Orbiter, launched on 10 February 2020, performed its first close approach to the Sun in mid-June, capturing unique views of our nearest star. No other images of the Sun have been taken from such a close distance, enabling scientists to catch a glimpse of new, interesting phenomena.
This image is particularly useful for performing classification analysis of e.g. different levels of energy.
